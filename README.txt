| STRATERGY USED|
-----------------

Our basic stratergy is initially at start of the game making primes near home board which makes our
position near home board as strong as possible.
Opponent thus gets blocked and gets less points free to come back in game , once he gets hit.

After making home board strong we use running game stratergy to get back our checkers 
to home board from opponent's home board.

We have maintain pip count to calculate where we exactly are in the game.

pipcount ->> gives avg. number of moves you have to move to complete the game.

During bear-off we are keeping in minds that if opponent has it's bots in our home during our bear-off
we choose move carefully and avoid leaving vulnerable checker.
